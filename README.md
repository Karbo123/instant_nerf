# PyTorch Implementation of Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (unofficial)

This repository tries to exactly reproduce the performance of instant-ngp in terms of both accuracy and speed, but it may only involve the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) part, because NeRF is becoming increasingly popular among the research community.

**Work in Progress**

# Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Karbo123/pytorch_instant_ngp.git --depth=1
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
